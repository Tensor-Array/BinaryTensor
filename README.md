# Binary Tensor

![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-17-blue)

This project is in experiment. Not final product.

A C++ bit-per-value tensor library that can be used to work with machine learning or deep learning project.

This library only using tensor that have only 1 bit per layer value. and only use one binary digits (0 or 1) as a value in a tensor. This library using bitwise operator to calculate tensor.

All arithmetic operators have been replaced with bitwise operator.
